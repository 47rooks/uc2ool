Unicode 2ool (Uc2ool) projects

Uc2ool is a Unicode utility for getting UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings for codepoints, for seeing the glyphs that are rendered for a code point and soon, vice-versa.

There are four subprojects in this repository:

  Uc2oolCore : the core application and model of the MVC.  
  Uc2oolJavafx : the JavaFX based VC portion of the MVC.  
  Uc2oolEclipse : an Eclipse plugin offering the same function.  
  Uc2oolAndroid : an Android version of the application.
  
  Uc2oolJavafx is coming very soon - a small refactoring only required.  
  Uc2oolEclipse and Uc2oolAndroid are not yet started.
